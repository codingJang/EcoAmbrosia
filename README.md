## I. Necessity and Purpose of Research

- Biochar is a multifunctional material with applications in soil environment improvement and carbon sequestration.
- Due to its porous nature, it can serve as an adsorbent for removing toxic substances from wastewater and contaminated soil.
- **Objective:** To contribute to ecosystem and environmental conservation by removing the ecosystem-threatening giant ragweed and using it to produce an eco-friendly adsorbent.

## II. Preliminary Research

- **Giant Ragweed in Sejong City:**
  - In line with the goal of building an environmentally friendly sustainable city, half of Sejong City's area is green (38 million m²).
  - However, giant ragweed colonies were found in neighborhood parks and trails near schools.

- **Meeting with Professor Woo Seung-Han from Hanbat University:**
  - Consulted with biochar expert Professor Woo Seung-Han.
  - Received advice on the suitability of the planned experiment, refinement of the experiment, grinding methods, pyrolysis equipment design, and additional experiments.

## III. Research Activities

### Collection and Drying of Giant Ragweed:
- Collected plants from the giant ragweed colonies found near the school during the first semester research period.
- Used 10L plastic bags to collect a total of 50L.
- Soaked in water for about an hour to remove insects that could interfere with pyrolysis, then dried in a well-ventilated place (S215 preparation room) for about a week.
- After the first drying, separated the leaves and stems (leaves were separated including the petiole).
- Dried for 24 hours using a food dryer (Shinil SFD-D2800R).
- Ground using an electric mill (BS-1000) (used the coarsest "10" out of 10 levels).
- Stored using a drying rack (SAMLA DRY KEEPER) for long-term storage.

### Production of Biochar:
- Used a pottery kiln (Seil furnace, household use) in the art room to pyrolyze the ground samples of giant ragweed leaves/stems at temperatures of 400℃ and 600℃ for 2 hours.

### Surface Structure Observation Using a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM):
- Images of the surface structures of the samples were captured.

### Performance Comparison Experiment of Biochar:
- The majority of adsorption was completed quickly within 4 minutes.
- The 600 biochar showed better adsorption capacity than the 400 biochar.
- Especially, the leaf-600 biochar had almost the same adsorption capacity as activated carbon.
- There was no clear difference between leaves and stems in the performance comparison experiment, despite the difference in surface structure.

## Conclusion and Suggestions

Our team has proven that the biochar we produced has an adsorption capacity that is not inferior to activated carbon. This demonstrates that the biochar made from giant ragweed is an eco-friendly adsorbent that considers both performance and the environment.
